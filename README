Required perl modules:

CGI
CGI::Application
CGI::FormBuilder
Config::Simple
DBI
SQL::Abstract
MIME::Lite::TT
Number::Bytes::Human
Filesys::Df

Other requirements:

apg
MySQL
mod_perl
pure-ftpd

To install:

 - Copy the contents of the ftp-admin folder to /var/www or similar
 - Make sure the perl modules are available by running perl -c Admin.pm
 - Edit the cfg.ini file - should be fairly self explanatory
 - Copy (or link) ftp-admin.apache.conf into /etc/apache2/conf.d and restart
   Apache
 - Create the mysql database:
    mysqladmin create pureftpd
    mysql pureftpd < ftp-admin.schema.sql
 - Set up pure-ftpd to look at the mysql database for its users (example config
   in pureftpd-mysql.conf)

When you login to the web page and create a user, it will make a directory
under the configured content_dir and then send an email to the user who created
the user. 

There is also a cronjob script which should be run nightly called
db-cleaner.pl, this will send reminder emails to people who have created FTP
accounts a day before they expire. It will also delete expired FTP accounts.
